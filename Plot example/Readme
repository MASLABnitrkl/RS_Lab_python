There are a few examples of using bar diagrams, pie charts, and scatter plots in this repository.

The bar diagram represents the sand grain size distribution by using Curiosity MAHLI (Edgett et al., 2012) observations. The associated data is 'Shivers_sol1793.csv'

The pie chart illustrates the mineral distribution at the Gale crater by using the Curiosity Chemin (Blake et al., 2012) observations. The associated data is 'chemin_2227.csv'

The scatter plot is between dune length, crest length and dune length, dune height for Herschel crater dunes (Banerjee et al., 2026). The data  associated data is 'dune_params.csv'.
